                            <p class="info-body">Set a goal to be a leader. We are all leaders. However, some choose to exercise this muscle and others are intimidated by it and believe it is a skill only a few have. Like everything else, everything has to be regularly practiced for us to reach our full potential. The lack to use their inner leader is costing people their full potential achievement, personal or professional. Yep, their full potential!</p>
                            <p class="info-body"><strong>Unfortunately, by the time a person realizes, “I am not where I want to be”,  it’s usually too late to fix it. </strong>So when they realize time has gone away, there may be nothing they can do except start over.</p>
                            <p class="info-body">In my late 20s, I was at a crossroads. I had a good job with 100s of people that reported to my department. However, I was not able to help them see my vision. I had to learn the difference between leading and managing. Once my mentor guided me, I went after developing my new skills with a vengeance.<strong> Some people can’t start over, so they give up or keep doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result — </strong>which makes achieving their success way less possible than it should be.</p>
