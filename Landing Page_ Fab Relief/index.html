										Coleman and the mindful habit has been a vital process to my freedom. <br>
										
										Coleman has personally helped me develop a greater self-worth and has showed me how to pull myself out of this mess into a higher realm of living. I've been able to open up to him and be honest about my shortcomings without any feelings of shame or embarrassment. <br>
										
										The mindset and resources that I've gained through this program have become keystone habits in my life as I face new challenges. <br>
										
										I will continue to stay plugged into this program and community since freedom it's a daily process that has to be walked out.  <br>
										
										I'd like to personally thank my coach Coleman for his professionalism, sincerity, genuine interest in my well-being and personal development.

									<h3 class="review-heading text-center">This review is for TMH system and 1-1 coaching with Coleman Baker</h3>
									<p class="review-body-modal text-justify">I had been using craigslist, dating apps, and cheating for about 5 years. Even after getting caught I still couldn't quit. The day my wife had the last straw and separated from me was the day I had to make drastic changes and I came across Coach Craig's sex and porn afflictions podcast. From there I found TMH program and decided to go with Coach Coleman Baker for 1-1 coaching. I can't say enough about the coaches and the program. This has been exactly what I've needed to snap me back into reality. I've now surpassed 100 days without any of that garbage and have made tremendous progress in changing my mindset, habits, health, relationships, and my career. I've spent a fare amount of money on my mental health and addiction but now I feel sharper than I've been in a very long time and am earning that money back with my newfound focus. <br>
									
									Enough about me though, this group genuinely cares. My worries from the heavy marketing that TMH was all about money were set at ease after a few calls. I've had the pleasure of meeting Coach Craig and he is the real deal, a top notch and world class coach. <br>
									
									Coach Coleman is an excellent coach, he listened carefully to me, empathized with me, and gave me encouraging or stern words when needed. I'm glad to count him as a friend and stay in touch with him on a monthly basis until one of us dies ; p

									<p class="review-body-modal text-justify">My first call with Craig was when I was at my lowest point -crying, ashamed about the things I'd done and depressed that my relationship was falling apart. He was professional, understanding, empathetic, and most of all -gave me hope that it wasn't all over. He was always understanding and accepting of my words, and was extremely flexible with in person and phone appointments, we even did some on skype. The best gift this program has given me is the hope that I'm not always destined to act on the lustful, perverted instincts of this alter ego side of me shaped by my family, upbringing, sexual views, and traumatic events . I am free to live my own life and to truly be the person I want to be. Although I know it's going to be a long journey through ebbs and flows (as life does) every struggle I've had has been so much easier to deal with knowing what I know now. Craig has given me invaluable insights and knowledge, breaking me down to my core and building me up to be the person I want to be. Craig has been there for me through thick and thin and has always been available when I needed him, as well as my partner. For that I am always grateful. Thank you Craig for changing my life for the better.</p>
